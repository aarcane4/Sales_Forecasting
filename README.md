## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict sales (specifically, `UnitPrice`) using historical sales data. The dataset used is `OnlineRetail.csv`, which contains transactional data for an online retail store. The project involves the following steps:
1. **Data Ingestion**: Load and inspect the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numeric features.
3. **Model Training**: Train a `RandomForestRegressor` model to predict sales.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
5. **Feature Importance**: Visualize the importance of features in the model.
